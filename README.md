# Welcome to the New and Improved Magic Item Store!

## Background for this Project
The game Dungeons and Dragons has been around for quite some time, and it's most recent edition (5th edition) has been around for quite awhile now too. However, the pricing for magic items within the game has always been a bit broken, and somebody has gone through the tedious process of re-pricing the items within the game into something that makes more logical sense within the world of DnD. That PDF can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8XAiXpOfz9cMWt1RTBicmpmUDg/view?usp=sharing).

## Project Goal
Using the PDF of sanely priced magical items, I wanted to make an application that makes use of these items. The end result is a terminal/command line tool (usable on either Apple's terminal or Windows command prompt) that let's you do the following:

* Search for Magic Items:
    - Returns a list of all magic items that contain part of what you search for

* Create a loot table of Magic Items:
    - Can choose the number of items to loot
    - Can filter items by rarity and the type of item (consumable, combat, non-combat)


## What's Next for this Project?
1. A website to make the application more usable and visually appealing.
2. A scroll generator/weapon generator. At the moment these are unspecified within the application.
3. Integration with the tables found in the Dungeon Master's Guide so there is a smooth transition from player's rolling dice to figuring out what loot is generated.
